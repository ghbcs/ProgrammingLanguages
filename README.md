I added Project Two Airgead Banking App to my repository.

I created an object-oriented programming (OOP) application using C++ code. 
The application had an input screen as well as two static reports that used the values of the user input. The two reports showed the user the comparison of investing with monthly deposits versus without monthly deposits.
I think the code I created is readable and the output menus are well formatted, and concise. As I was working on this projects I have learned to comment out code that causes the errors and run the program without those individual lines of code to see how the program runs. Project Two was challenging because of all the variables and calculations that were required for the code in the project. Also formatting the form with the final results was very challenging.
